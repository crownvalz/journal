1. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   Navigate to your project directory and activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
   The terminal prompt should change, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

2. **Install Flask**:
   With the virtual environment activated, install Flask by running:
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

3. **Verify Flask Installation**:
   After Flask is installed, verify that it is installed correctly:
   ```bash
   pip show flask
   ```

4. **Install Missing Packages (like reportlab)**:
   If your app needs other packages (e.g., `reportlab`), install them:
   ```bash
   pip install reportlab
   ```

5. **Run the Flask Application**:
   Now that the necessary packages are installed, run your Flask application:
   ```bash
   /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/journal/.venv/bin/python /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/journal/app.py
   ```
